## Installation

### Build from Git

#### Prerequisites
Before starting the installation process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.9 or later installed on your machine.
- Docker installed and properly configured for your operating system.

### Step 1: Set up the Python Environment
Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended) for your project:
   ```shell
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

#### 1. Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS and Linux:
   ```shell
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   ```shell
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

#### 2. Install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Running the Application Locally
1. Change to the project's root directory
```shell
  cd MODULES
```
2. Execute the following command to start the Uvicorn server locally:
```shell
uvicorn RESTAPI.rest:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
3.The REST API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000. You can interact with it using API testing tools such as curl or Postman.

### Running with Docker

#### Prerequisites
- Before starting the installation process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Docker installed and properly configured for your operating system.

### Step 1: Building and Running the Docker Container
1. Ensure that Docker is running on your machine.
2. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:
```shell
docker build -t my-docker-image .
```
3. Once the image is built, run the Docker container:
```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-docker-image
```
4. The REST API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000, just like when running it locally.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run your project either using GitHub or Docker. Choose the appropriate method based on your requirements and preferences.

5. Fill in the necessary connection details, including **Hostname**, **Port**, **Username**, and **Password**.

6. Click **Test Connection** to verify that the connection is successful.

7. Once the connection is established, click **OK** to save the MySQL connection.

### Step 3: Create Database Schema

1. In MySQL Workbench, select your established MySQL connection from the "MySQL Connections" pane.

2. Click on the **Schema** tab located in the lower-left section of the window.

3. Right-click anywhere in the **Schema** tab and select **Create Schema**.

4. Provide a name for your new schema and click **Apply**.

5. The new schema will be created and displayed in the **Schema** tab.

### Step 5: Run the Project

1. With MySQL Workbench set up, the MySQL connection established, and the schema created, you are now ready to run your project.

2. Follow the instructions mentioned in the previous sections of this README to install any project dependencies and start the application.

## Project Components

### Source

This project utilizes different technologies for data retrieval, storage, and AI processing. Here are the components involved:

#### HTTP Endpoint

The HTTP endpoint serves as the data source for your project. It allows you to fetch data required for processing from an external API or web service. You can configure the HTTP endpoint by providing the necessary URL, parameters, and authentication credentials, if applicable.

#### MySQL Database

The MySQL database acts as the storage backend for your project. It enables persistent storage and retrieval of data. Your project interacts with the MySQL database to store and retrieve information as needed. You will need to provide the required connection details, such as the host, port, username, and password, to establish a connection with the MySQL database.

#### MindsDB Integration

MindsDB is an integral part of your project's AI capabilities. It is an open-source tool that facilitates the generation of machine learning models using automated machine learning (AutoML). Your project leverages MindsDB to create, train, and deploy machine learning models based on the data obtained from the HTTP endpoint and stored in the MySQL database. To integrate MindsDB into your project, you will need to configure it with your MindsDB username and password.

### Outputs

#### API Output

The API output option allows you to access the predicted values generated by your project through a RESTful API in JSON format. This enables easy integration with other applications or systems. Follow the steps below to configure and utilize the API output:

Set up the API endpoint and define the desired routes for accessing the predicted values.
Implement the necessary API logic to generate the predictions and return them in JSON format.
When the API endpoint is accessed, the predicted values will be returned as a JSON response.
The JSON response will typically include the predicted values for the requested data points or entities. The structure of the JSON response may vary depending on your project's specific requirements and the nature of the predictions.
